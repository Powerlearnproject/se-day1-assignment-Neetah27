# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
;Software engineering has to do with the process of building, testing, designing and maintaining software.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
answer; Mastering process, mastering complexity and mastering machine.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer; planning,requirement analtysis, design, coding and testing.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
answer; waterfall methodology is linear and sequential while agile methodology is iterative and incremental with multiple cycles,


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
answer; a software engineer programs and develops the code. a quality assurance  engineer collaborates with stakeholders while a proect manager assembles and leads the software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
answer; prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
